## Basic Usage

All python packages necessary to run our code are in the `pyproject.toml` file. We suggest the use of Poetry for package dependency management.

## Datasets Download

To download the datasets used in our project, go to the root project directory and run the following script

```
python src/data/download_data.py
```

This will create a folder `data/raw` in the root directory with the raw datasets.
